I'm a PhD student at the Pure Mathematics department in University of Waterloo. Also a member of the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/). My supervisors are [David Kribs](https://dkribs.uoguelph.ca/) and [Michael Brannan](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~m2branna/).


### Education:
PhD (Expected 2023), University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada

MSc Mathematics (2018), University College Cork, Ireland

BSc Physics and Mathematics (2017), University College Cork, Ireland


### Research:
I'm interested in Quantum Information Theory and Operator Algebras. Particularly I have been studying quantum superchannels and the operator system spanned by quantum channels.
